# Junior Data Analyst Technical Assessment 

## Intro

As a Data Analyst at Rockefeller Capital Management, you will regularly clean, analyze and present data that gives transparency into business operations and context to decisions we make about how to grow or engage with our clients. Your ability to write reproducible, generalizable code to access data from a variety of sources, analyze it and communicate your findings will be an important part of your day-to-day work. To that end, we'd love to see you take real transaction data and gather insights from it!

## General guidelines:
- We should be able to replicate your work - please provide any code, notes, and/or documents you used while analyzing the data. This helps follow your thought process.
- Feel free to tackle the dataset however you'd like – use any language or tools you want to, and visualize this data however seems appropriate and with any tool you feel is best suited to the task.
- Please provide notes or a summary of how you worked through the analysis. This homework is meant for us to understand how you think through a problem.
- Don't fret about getting the *right* answer (there isn't one). How you communicate your approach to this analysis is just as important.
- If you find that you have some time and want to investigate ideas outside of the questions below, we'd be delighted but it's not expected.

## Instructions

In raw_data folder, there are 4 related datasets: a dataset of transactions, a dataset of products, a dataset of product_classes, and a dataset with information about promotions. The original source is a freely available Foodmart dataset, downloaded from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/dlpage.phi-integration.com/pentaho/mondrian/mysql-foodmart-database/foodmart_mysql.tar.gz). You might need to do some cleaning to the data to get it into a workable state.

**Question 1**

Management is trying to better understand what is happening at these food marts. Please create some visualizations to help us better understand the following aspects of the Foodmart data:
- Category of products sold
- Brand of products sold

**Question 2**

Foodmart is developing their strategy for the next year. One of their goals is to increase sales and profitability. Please provide the executive team with insights from the data that highlight growth opportunities. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Expand product offerings: which products or categories should we expand and why?
- Offer more promotions: how should we target our promotions and why?
- Market to a certain customer segment: what segment of customers should we market to and how?

Feel free to think of other ideas. Please focus on only 1 to 2 opportunities and provide an executive summary of your recommendations, the potential impact, and what data you found to support your strategy.

## How We Will Evaluate Your Submission

Your responses to these questions will be evaluated on three criteria: analytical skill, technical skill, and presentation. Analytical skill will be assessed based on your ability to answer the questions backed up by data. Technical skill will be assessed based on your ability to create a clean, reproducible dataset with the tools you choose use. Lastly, presentation will be assessed on our ability to easily follow your submission and arrive at the conclusions you’ve made.
